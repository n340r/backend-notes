# ✨ Soft Skill Dumb Questions

## 🇬🇧 Basic

“I want to mention that I have a stutter problem that can show up under stress. I’m currently **undergoing speech therapy**, so i might **speak slowlier than usual** or **take a moment to phrase something**, that’s expected. With that out of the way lets proceed”

### Tell us about your most recent workplace and the project you worked on.

Most recently I worked at **ETG**, a global flight and hotel booking platform operating in **over 100 countries**, handling very **high traffic at peak** - close 10K RPS.

My main focus was **extracting core search and booking legecy functionality** from monolith into independent microservices written in Go and Node.js.  
I worked on **defining service boundaries**, **migrating critical logic**, and setting up **CI/CD**, infrastructure, and monitoring.

_Frontend side of things:_

As for the frontend part of it, worked closely with **UI and Analytics team** to understand user behaviour and update
UI based on real data. That way we **redesigned core components** such as **Hotel Card** and drove significant improvements in terms of clicks and conversion into bookings.

_Another project:_

One more big project i can tell you about is a huge personal account page for hotel owners. My work was to refactor complex **legacy form on the frontend** and underlying
**backend logic** for **fine-grained hotel rate creation**. The challenge was to properly test and handle **more than a hundred cases** as well as **add new ones** wihout breaking
existing functionality. This obviously improved reliability and reduces support overhead which was massive before.

### Tell us about your team at your last job. How were responsibilities distributed? How did collaboration work?

- I worked across **several cross-functional teams**, typically \*10–15 people\*\* split into smaller sub-teams depending on the project. All developers were fullstack, so responsibility was shared — if you pick up a feature, you own both the backend and frontend parts.
- Process itself is a modified scrum. What this means is we have **2-week sprints**, **Grooming and planning** at the  
  beginning of each sprint, **no daily standups** - instead we do short project sync meetings twice a week and async
  communication, **team-wide retro** at the end of each sprint
- My role in all of this was: since technical requirements often come from managers words without any docs or technical
  specification, my goal was to ask additional questions, help clarify technical moments, and make sure me and my team
  will be able to hit the goal in the upcoming sprint.

**Please tell us about your main technology stack in recent years.**
Go, TypeScript, Node.js, React

### Tell us about your main achievements at work. What are you most proud of?

My biggest achievement was **leading the extraction of the core booking** flow from a large 5-year monolith **into an independent microservices**.

This was challenging because I **wasn’t building something from scratch** — I **had to understand and isolate functionality** that had grown organically over years.

1. **identified boundaries**
2. **write missing tests for existing logic**
3. **extracted and rewrote critical logic**
4. created a **clean architecture**
5. implemented **gRPC communication** full test coverage
6. built **Docker images**, and configured **CI/CD and monitoring** for smooth deployment and manitainability of each
   microservice

The result was a much more stable booking flow and a measurable improvement in performance and conversion. It also enabled the team to ship new booking features much faster.”

### Tell us about the most difficult task you had to deal with in the past year. What challenge did you face, and what did you learn from it?

One of the hardest challenges was the **same project — extracting the booking logic** from the monolith.  
As in most **refactor-old-corporate-functionality** tasks, complexity **wasn’t the code** itself, but discovering
**hidden dependencies** that accumulated over years.
The difficulties were:

- dozens of implicit flows,
- undocumented legacy logic,
- tight coupling between modules.

I think what i learned by this is **pacience**, once again, the **importance of testing**, careful deployment with
**blue-green deployment**, **feature-toggles**

### If you are applying for a Senior position: do you have experience in building a project from scratch and designing application architecture? Please describe it in more detail.

Yes. At ETG and previously at WowTickets I designed and built multiple microservices from scratch. Even though the logic **partially existed in the monolith**, the architecture
had to be created from zero —

- clean module structure
- APIs
- communication between microservices
- tests
- observability
- Dockerization and smooth deployment, and CI/CD.

In total I've designed **more than 10 services end-to-end**: from business requirements to production deployment.

### Please share what motivated you to start looking for a new job and what factors led to your decision to leave your previous role.\*\*

I had a **great experience at ETG** — strong team, interesting technical challenges, high-load application. But after **living in the UK for over a year**, I realized
I want to **integrate more** and work in a **fully English-speaking**, fast-paced environment. My team was mostly Russian-speaking and management was English-speaking, so communication wasn’t always aligned with how I want to **grow professionally**.
So now I’m looking for an **English-speaking** team, more **exposure to product discussions**, and a company where I can **contribute long-term.**

---

### What tasks are you interested in working on right now? And what would you like to work on in the future?

I'm motivated by **technical challenges**, X (_high-load_ or _fast-paced_ based on corporate / startup) where good engineering really matters
I enjoy coding and solving complex tasks. Tech stack and the exact is **slightly less** important.
To answer your question straight, im ideally looking for

- Smart engineers in the team
- intresting and tough problems
- room to grow technically and learn

---

### Please clarify if you have any time constraints (vacation, existing offers, or anything else).

No time constraints, notice period is **up to a week, maybe less**

---

### How actively are you searching for a new position ? You have any offers / final stages at the moment ? If so, what is stopping you from taking the offer ?

Yeah, currently I’m currently both having conversations **with several companies**, and I received **some early offers**. But **I set a specific time window** to speak with the companies
I’m genuinely interested in — to compare teams, culture, and technical challenges.

I’m not rushing. I want to make a **thoughtful long-term decision.**

---

### Are you currently working full-time ? What made you consider a contract role ? (thats unusual switching from full-time to contract)

I’m open to both full-time and contract formats since i worked both and both suit me just fine. For me the agreement type is secondary - what matters
is the work, the team, and the opportunity to contribute. I adapt quickly and I’m **comfortable working in a fast-paced environment**, so a **contract role works perfectly fine**.

---

### Leadership, mentoring, hiring developers

I **wasn’t a formal manager**, but I often acted as a **technical lead on projects**.

For example:

- I **led the extraction of the booking engine** from the monolith — defining the architecture, breaking down tasks, coordinating backend/frontend efforts, and guiding other developers through the new service boundaries.
- I mentored several **junior and mid-level engineers**: code reviews, pair programming, explaining architecture decisions, and helping them onboard into complex parts of the system.

- I **coordinated cross-team** work with analytics, DevOps, QA, and designers to ensure smooth delivery.

- I mainly want to write code but i enjoy leadership **that is still hands-on** work
